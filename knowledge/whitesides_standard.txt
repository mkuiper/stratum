# The Whitesides Standard for Scientific Papers

## Core Philosophy

A scientific paper is an organized description of hypotheses, data, and conclusions.

## Key Principles

### 1. Hypothesis-Driven Analysis

A paper exists to answer a question or test a hypothesis. Every element should connect back to:
- What question is being investigated?
- What was the proposed answer (hypothesis)?
- How was this tested?

### 2. Data-Centric Approach

Text is secondary; data is primary. Every claim must be anchored to specific evidence:
- Tables showing numerical results
- Figures visualizing data
- Equations formalizing relationships
- Statistical tests demonstrating significance

### 3. Logical Structure Over Chronological Narrative

Papers are not stories of discovery. They should be organized by:
- Importance of findings
- Logical flow from hypothesis to conclusion
- Strength of evidence

Ignore the chronological sequence ("first we did X, then Y"). Focus on the argument structure:
"Given hypothesis H, we show evidence E1, E2, E3, therefore conclusion C."

### 4. Evidence Anchoring

Every key point must reference its supporting evidence:
- "The model achieves 95% accuracy" → "Table 2"
- "Temperature affects reaction rate" → "Figure 3"
- "Results are statistically significant" → "p < 0.001, Student's t-test"

## Application to Stratum

When analyzing papers with Stratum:

1. **Extract the Central Hypothesis**
   - Not just "we studied X"
   - But "we hypothesized that X causes Y because of Z"

2. **Identify Key Data Points**
   - Each with specific figure/table reference
   - Confidence score based on evidence strength
   - Ignore unsupported claims

3. **Map Logic Chains**
   - How do the key points connect?
   - What argument leads from hypothesis to conclusion?
   - What is the logical flow?

4. **Classify Citations**
   - Foundational: Work we build upon
   - Comparison: Alternative approaches we compare against
   - Refuting: Claims we challenge or contradict

## Example Analysis

**Paper**: "Deep Learning for Climate Prediction"

**Central Hypothesis**:
"Deep neural networks can improve long-term climate prediction accuracy compared to traditional statistical models."

**Key Points**:
- KP1: "Proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid achieves 23% lower RMSE than ARIMA baseline" (Table 3, confidence: 0.92)
- KP2: "Improvement is statistically significant (p < 0.001, paired t-test)" (Figure 4, confidence: 0.95)
- KP3: "Model captures non-linear dynamics that traditional models miss" (Figure 5, confidence: 0.85)

**Logic Chain**:
KP1 (lower error) → KP2 (statistically significant) → KP3 (captures complexity) →
**Conclusion**: Deep learning significantly outperforms traditional methods for climate prediction.

**Citations**:
- Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) "LSTM Networks" → Foundational (provides core architecture)
- Box & Jenkins (1976) "ARIMA Models" → Comparison (baseline method)
- Smith et al. (2020) "Climate Models" → Foundational (provides dataset and evaluation metrics)
